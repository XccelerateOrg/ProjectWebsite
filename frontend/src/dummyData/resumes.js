    description:
      "I have been teaching in an urban public school (Cambridge) for three years. My role has enabled me to be extremely growth oriented: I am curious on what systems classrooms have in place that allow students to perform at their best. Teaching has furthered my understanding of what it means to problem solve - it is, of course, meeting practical needs, but also ensuring everyone buys into the importance of what I have to share. Without effectively conveying why it is important or worth knowing, students may never care about what they are learning. Understanding how to meet each personâ€™s needs is essential in helping things run smoothly. In other words, it's the skill of managing groups of teenagers while not getting killed.",
